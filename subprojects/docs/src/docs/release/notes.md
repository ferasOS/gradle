### Continuous build now works with composite builds

Gradle's [continuous build feature](userguide/continuous_build.html) now works with [composite builds](userguide/composite_builds.html). Gradle will automatically detect changes to any input from any build and rebuild the appropriate pieces.

### CodeNarc plugin supports report format 'console'

The CodeNarc plugin now supports outputting reports directly to the console through the `console` report format.
```
codenarc {
    reportFormat = 'console'
}
```

### Faster Gradle command line client

The Gradle command line client now starts up ~200ms faster, speeding up every build.

### APIs to define calculated task input and output locations

TBD - This release builds on the `Provider` concept added in Gradle 4.0 to add conveniences that allow plugins and build scripts to define task input and output locations that are calculated lazily. For example, a common problem when implementing a plugin is how to define task output locations relative to the project's build directory in a way that deals with changes to the build directory location later during project configuration.

- Added `Directory` and `RegularFile` abstractions and providers to represent locations that are calculated lazily.
- Added a `ProjectLayout` service that allows input and output locations to be defined relative to the project's project directory and build directory. 
- `Project.file()` and `Project.files()` can resolve `Provider` instances to `File` and `FileCollection` instances.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to handling of project dependencies from project that does not use the Java plugin to a project that does

When a project that does not use the Java plugin has a project dependency on a project that uses the Java plugin, either directly or indirectly via another plugin, then the `runtimeElements` configuration of the target project will be selected. Previous versions of Gradle would select the `default` configuration in this case.

Previous versions of Gradle would select the `runtimeElements` when both projects are using the Java plugin.

This change makes the selection behaviour consistent so that the `runtimeElements` configuration is selected regardless of whether the consuming project uses the Java plugin or not. This is also consistent with the selection when the consuming project is using one of the Android plugins.

### test.testNameIncludePatterns property now overrides test.include and test.exclude

The `testNameIncludePatterns` property and the corrspondig command line option `--tests` now override any `include` and `exclude` defined in the test task configuration. This corresponds to behavior that is described in the [Test filtering](userguide/java_plugin.html#test_filtering) documentation. Previous versions of Gradle did not implemented this overriding behavior. Instead, the filters were combined. For the previous behavior, use `test.filter.includePatterns` instead of `test.testNameIncludePatterns`.
